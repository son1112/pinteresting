* One Month Rails

This is the pinteresting sample application for [[http://onemonthrails.com][*One Month Rails*]], 
by [[http://mattangriffel.com][Mattan Griffel]].

I began calling it PinTrance, poking fun at the trance-like state
that my wife would be in, staring at her phone all night, looking 
through pins on Pinterest. Eventually, this application will
have trance-inducing features as well. For now, it's just a fun
exploration project for me to learn Ruby on Rails.
